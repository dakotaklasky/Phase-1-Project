Welcome to the Virtual Met Museum!

The Metropolitan Museum of Art is one of the largest museums in the country. It can be difficult to see everything in one visit and everytime I go back I tend to discover something new. This website intends to help the user see works of art that may otherwise get overlooked during an in-person visit, all from the comfort of their own home. 

This site displays a random image from the Met's vast online catalogue (all work that considered in the public domain). If there is a particular area of interest the user is welcome to filter the selection based on their department of interest.

Each image is linked to the official Met webpage for the work of art if the user wants to know more. 

A back button is also featured so an image is not lost after it gets displayed.
